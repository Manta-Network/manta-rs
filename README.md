_Rust Crates for the Manta Network Ecosystem_

## About

The `manta-rs` libraries represent the core logic of the Manta Network protocols shared across all of its products. This project is built as a monorepo for the foundational Rust codebase of Manta. See the following repositories for projects by Manta Network that build off of `manta-rs`:

- [`Manta`](https://github.com/manta-network/Manta): Core blockchain node implementations built on [`substrate`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)
- [`manta-signer`](https://github.com/manta-network/manta-signer): Desktop ZKP prover and wallet implementation
- [`manta-front-end`](https://github.com/manta-network/manta-front-end): Web dApp for interacting with Manta networks
- [`sdk`](https://github.com/manta-network/sdk): Software Development Kit for building wallets and dApps on top of Manta

The protocols implemented in `manta-rs` are described by the [Manta Specifications](https://github.com/manta-network/spec). See those documents for more information.
