//! Wallet Abstractions
//!
//! This module defines the notion of a "wallet" which can store and manage accounts that control
//! private assets, those defined in [`crate::asset`] and [`crate::transfer`]. The [`Wallet`]
//! abstraction implements the main interface to an account and requires two asynchronous
//! connections, one to a transaction signer and secret manager called the [`Signer`] and another
//! connection to the [`Ledger`] itself. The wallet itself only stores the information related to
//! the current balances of any particular account and queries the [`Signer`] and the [`Ledger`] to
//! get the newest balances from incoming transactions and to send out transactions of its own.
//!
//! [`Signer`]: signer::Connection
//! [`Ledger`]: ledger::Connection
