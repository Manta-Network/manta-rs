/// Ledger Connection
///

/// ledger, you can establish a connection first and then interact via the [`Read`] and [`Write`]
/// `trait`s which send messages along the connection.
pub trait Connection {

/// Ledger Checkpoint
///
/// The checkpoint type is responsible for keeping the ledger, signer, and wallet in sync with each
/// other making sure that they all have the same view of the ledger state. Checkpoints should
/// be orderable with a bottom element returned by [`Default::default`]. Types implementing this
/// `trait` must also implement [`Clone`], [`Send`], and [`Sync`] as it must be safe
/// (but not necessarily efficient) to copy a checkpoint value and share it across threads.

/// that comes from the ledger must be compatible with the checkpoints that request them. This
/// `trait` requires that data can be pruned to meet a known checkpoint and can also update its own
/// origin checkpoint to the state that it would be at after the state would return itself from
/// the [`read`] call. In the same way that the [`Checkpoint`]s represent monotonically increasing
/// state markers, the data returned from the ledger must fit into this increasing set.
