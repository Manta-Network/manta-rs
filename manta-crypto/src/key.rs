//! Key Primitives

/// Key-Agreement Scheme
///
/// # Specification
///
/// All implementations of this trait must adhere to the following properties:
///
/// 1. **Agreement**: For all possible inputs, the following function returns `true`:
///
///     ```text
///     fn agreement(lhs: SecretKey, rhs: SecretKey) -> bool {
///         agree(lhs, derive(rhs)) == agree(rhs, derive(lhs))
///     }
///     ```
///     This ensures that both parties in the shared computation will arrive at the same conclusion
///     about the value of the [`SharedSecret`](Self::SharedSecret).
pub trait KeyAgreementScheme {
    /// Secret Key Type
    type SecretKey;

    /// Public Key Type
    type PublicKey;

    /// Shared Secret Type
    type SharedSecret;

    /// Derives a public key corresponding to `secret_key`. This public key should be sent to the
    /// other party involved in the shared computation.
    fn derive(secret_key: &Self::SecretKey) -> Self::PublicKey;

    /// Derives a public key corresponding to `secret_key`. This public key should be sent to the
    /// other party involved in the shared computation.
    ///
    /// # Implementation Note
    ///
    /// This method is an optimization path for [`derive`] when we own the `secret_key` value, and
    /// by default, uses [`derive`] as its implementation. This method must return the same value
    /// as [`derive`] on the same input.
    ///
    /// [`derive`]: Self::derive
    #[inline]
    fn derive_owned(secret_key: Self::SecretKey) -> Self::PublicKey {
        Self::derive(&secret_key)
    }

    /// Computes the shared secret given the known `secret_key` and the given `public_key`.
    fn agree(secret_key: &Self::SecretKey, public_key: &Self::PublicKey) -> Self::SharedSecret;
}
