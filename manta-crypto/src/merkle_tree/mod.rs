// TODO:  Should `Leaf` move into `Tree`/`Configuration` since we might want the tree to have
//        special kinds of leaf input (metadata along with just the digest)?
// TODO:  Maybe we should require `INNER_HEIGHT` instead of `HEIGHT` so that we don't have to rely
//        on the user to check that `HEIGHT >= 2`.
// TODO:  Extend to arbitrary arity.
